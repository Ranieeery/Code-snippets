The project includes the following functions:

- `temp()`: This function reads the temperature sensor and converts the analog value to temperature in Celsius.

- `LCD()`: This function controls the LCD display and shows different messages based on the temperature reading and button status.

- `luz()`: This function turns on the lamp.

- `servom()`: This function controls the servo motor (faucet) based on the reading from the sensor.

- `botao1()`: This function handles the button press and toggles the button status.

Please note that the code provided is written in Arduino programming language and can be used to implement the mentioned functions in the greenhouse automation project.
